Multiple factors contribute to path loss in HF transmissions. One of these factors is absorption in the ionosphere. Modelling total path loss due to absorption can be challenging due to the fact that the rate of absorption in the ionosphere varies with altitude. The purpose of this research is to build a Python-based model that accurately computes total absorption along a signal's path through the D-Region of the ionosphere. Numerical methods can be used to make these computations without relying on overly simplified assumptions.
