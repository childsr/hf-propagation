High Frequency (HF) (3–30 MHz range), are capable of long-distance communication through skywave propagation. Radio signals are travelling upward into the atmosphere interact with the ionosphere, a region of the upper atmosphere ionized by solar radiation. Depending on the frequency of the signal and the current state of the ionosphere, the wave may be refracted back toward the Earth, causing it to "bounce" and travel beyond line of sight.
A major consideration with HF communications is the absorption of the signal as it passes through the ionosphere. This research focuses solely on the D-Region, the lowest layer of the ionosphere and the one that contributes the greatest amount of absorption.
With this research, I hope to demonstrate the accuracy of existing ionopheric absorption models using numerical integration to compute total path loss and using data from the International Reference Ionoshpere (IRI-2020) and NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center's D-Region Absorption Predictions (D-RAP).
The critical value when computing absorption in the ionosphere is absorption coefficient, usually written as κ. Multiple approximations for the value of the κ exist. The purpose of this project is to use those approximations to compute total absorption along the entire path travelled by an HF signal. κ is in units of decibels per meter (dB/m), which makes integration fairly straightforward. We simply need to sum up the total absorption in dB that accumulates during the signal's journey. Since the signal gets refracted back down in the F-Layer, high above the D-Region, we need consider the signal's path up through the D-Region and back down.
